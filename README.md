<h1>Automatic-NumberPlate-Detection</h1>
The project on vehicle authentication integrates image detection, recognition, and Python programming to establish a robust security-based authentication system. 
Leveraging machine learning techniques, the model is trained on a dataset comprising images containing vehicle number plates to enhance accuracy in plate recognition.
Upon vehicle entry, the system extracts the number plate and performs a matching process against authorized plates, promptly alerting authorities in case of unauthorized access.
This innovative solution holds significant potential across various security applications, providing a proactive means for authorities to take appropriate actions based on real-time alerts. 
By combining image processing techniques with EasyOCR, the system efficiently filters images and trains the OCR model to accurately recognize text. In practical implementation, when a vehicle enters a restricted area, the system swiftly checks the number plate against an authorized database. 
In the event of a mismatch, automated notifications are promptly dispatched to the relevant authorities, enabling swift response to unautho rized access attempts.
This project represents a sophisticated yet user-friendly approach to enhancing security measures, ensuring stringent enforcement of access control protocols to safeguard restricted areas effectively.
